# Possible Extension Ideas

Here I will summarise extensions and it will be where I record ideas and thoughts during the project.

- Could use Thymeleaf for providing the webpages using thymeleaf as an extension instead of just Angular.

- Could use testcontainers within Java 25 to build docker containers for testing as an interesting extra.

- Could showcase some interesting features of Java 25 like stream operators and Record data structures.
