# Definite inclusions for this project.
Under this heading, I will detail the additional features I have added with a small justification for their use/implementation.
- ResponseEntity class => this is a great way to return an object from the api with a return statuscode (from HttpStatus enumerated type).


# Possible Extension Ideas

Here I will summarise extensions and it will be where I record ideas and thoughts during the project.
This is mainly so that I can record my ideas but also can add my overnight eureka moments (and what I remember doing from previous projects in Java Spring).

- Could use Thymeleaf for providing the webpages using thymeleaf as an extension instead of just Angular.

- Could use testcontainers within Java 25 to build docker containers for testing as an interesting extra.

- Could showcase some interesting features of Java 25 like stream operators and Record data structures.

- Gitlab CI/CD integrations with gitlab-ci.yaml file

- Branch and release strategy using dev/test and prod branches and building appropriate containers with specific properties.

- Security implementation with WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter and in particular - use of CORS to limit which urls frontend traffic can send to and enforce security by design.

- Endpoint E2E testing (possibly could use curl/postman and add to demo).

- Use of tool such as prometheus to provide actuator endpoints to check for service and container health.

- Portainer showcase as an example of how we can manage these containerised ecosystems at scale.

- Authentication layer with JWT token
