# Assumptions made for this coding challenge.
I'm going to treat the feature expectations and requirements as their own iterations by feature branch with the following identifiers for ease of use and clarification.
Usually I'd expect my feature requirements and expectations for a given sprint to come from a project management tool such as JIRA, and this document is intended to mimic this issue ticket style.

## Feature branches:

### FT-100-java-spring-initial-setup
As a java developer I want to have a basic program written in Java Spring and tested with JUnit for MVC usage, compiled and ready for coming iterations.
Acceptance criteria: Java program compiles without errors and tests pass for basic skeleton scenarios such as hello world.
